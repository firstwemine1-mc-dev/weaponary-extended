# Weaponry

Fabric mod for Minecraft **26.3** (Java 25, unobfuscated). It adds 10 melee weapons in
5 material tiers, for 50 items in total, each with its own abilities (see [Abilities](#abilities)).

Built from the official [fabric-example-mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod)
template (`26.3` branch). A pristine copy of that template lives at `../fabric-example-mod`.

## Side

`"environment": "*"`. Install the mod on **both client and server**. New items are registered on the server and
synced to the client, so the mod can't be client-only, and a vanilla client can't join a server that has it.

## Weapons

| Weapon | Dmg vs sword | Speed | Reach | Durability × | Two-handed* |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Dagger | −2 | 2.4 | 2.5 | 0.75 | |
| Sabre | −1 | 2.0 | 3.0 | 1.0 | |
| Scimitar | 0 | 1.6 | 3.0 | 1.0 | yes |
| Spear | −1 | 1.4 | 4.0 | 1.0 | |
| Pike | 0 | 1.0 | 5.0 | 1.2 | yes |
| Lance | −2 | 0.8 | 4.5 | 0.6 | yes |
| Halberd | +2 | 0.9 | 4.0 | 1.2 | yes |
| Hatchet | +1 | 1.1 | 2.75 | 1.0 | |
| War Hammer | +3 | 0.7 | 3.0 | 1.5 | yes |
| Club | −1 | 1.2 | 3.0 | 1.5 | |

Tiers are wooden, stone, iron, golden and diamond. Damage bonus, enchantability, repair item and base
durability all come from the vanilla tier. Source: `../pixel-art/weaponry/docs/weapon-stats.md`.

\* Needs both hands. While it's in the main hand, whatever is in the off hand (a shield, a torch...) is moved
into your inventory, and a two-handed weapon put in the off hand is moved out too. The action bar says what moved.
If the inventory is full, the item stays in the off hand but is blocked: no shield, no dual wielding, no off-hand
item use, and a raised shield is lowered.

## Abilities

From `../pixel-art/weaponry/docs/weapon-stats.md` section 4. "Full charge" means the attack cooldown is over 90%,
the same threshold vanilla uses for sweeps and crits.

| Weapon | Passive | Active |
|---|---|---|
| Dagger | **Backstab:** ×1.5 damage when hitting a target from behind (within 60° of straight behind it). Critical hits cause **Bleed**. | **Throw:** like the spear. Melee damage +1, and it causes **Bleed**. |
| Sabre | +2 damage while mounted. | **Riposte:** use to parry for 0.5 s (1 s cooldown). Parrying a frontal melee hit cancels it, and your next hit within 3 s is a guaranteed crit. |
| Scimitar | **Draw Cut:** full-charge, grounded, non-sprinting hits sweep, with about 1.5× the vanilla sweep area. Everything the sweep hits, the main target included, gets **Bleed**. | |
| Spear | Reach 4. +1 damage on a sprinting hit. | **Throw:** hold use (at least 0.5 s) and release. Melee damage +2. It drops where it lands; pick it up again. |
| Pike | Reach 5. Half damage against targets under 1.5 blocks away. | **Brace:** sneak and stand still. Hits on targets charging at you (2+ blocks/s, on foot or mounted) do double damage and dismount riders. |
| Lance | No critical hits. | **Couched Charge:** hit while riding a mount moving at 4+ blocks/s. Bonus damage = 0.8 × mount speed (blocks/s), max +15, plus heavy knockback and the target is dismounted. Costs 3 durability. |
| Halberd | Reach 4. Disables shields like an axe. | **Hook:** use on a target in reach (2 s cooldown, 1 durability). Pulls it toward you, pulls it off its mount, and knocks a raised shield aside. |
| Hatchet | Disables shields. Mines wood at axe speed and takes Efficiency, Fortune and Silk Touch. | **Throw:** like the spear, but short range and spinning. Melee damage +1. |
| War Hammer | **Armor Crush:** ignores 50% of the target's armor. Full-charge hits cause **Stagger** for 1 s. | **Overhead Smash:** a full-charge hit while sneaking knocks back everything within 2.5 blocks of the target, and everything it hits (target included) gets **Stun** for 0.75 s. |
| Club | +1 knockback. **Daze:** full-charge hits have a 20% chance to cause **Daze** for 2 s. | |

Material twists:

- **Wooden:** half the armor crush; Bleed lasts 2 s.
- **Stone:** +1 knockback on the club and war hammer.
- **Golden:** ability numbers × 1.5 (bonus damage, effect durations, daze chance, hook pull, smash knockback, armor crush).
- **Diamond:** +1 throw damage; Bleed lasts 6 s.

Status effects (`effect/ModEffects`), each with its own icon:

| Effect | Does | From |
|---|---|---|
| **Bleed** | 1 damage per second per stack for 4 s, ignoring armor and hit cooldown. Each new application adds a stack (max 3, shown as Bleed II/III) and refreshes the duration. Undead and golems are immune. | Dagger crits and throws, scimitar sweeps |
| **Stagger** | A short, sharp screen lurch for a staggered player. No slowdown. | War hammer full-charge hits |
| **Stun** | 90% slower, nearly rooted. | War hammer smash |
| **Daze** | 15% slower (like Slowness I), and a dazed player's view wobbles like Nausea. | Club |

The icons are drawn in `../pixel-art/weaponry/designs/effects/` (16×16). `python scripts/copy_effect_icons.py`
copies them to `textures/mob_effect/` with a 1 px transparent border, because the game draws effect icons at 18×18.
Bleed damage uses the `weaponry:bleed` damage type (`data/weaponry/damage_type/`), tagged to bypass armor and
hit cooldown.

Also not done yet: the lance's "−1 speed tier on foot" (it is already the slowest weapon), and the brace doesn't lock movement.

## Recipes (M = material, S = stick)

The material is planks, stone tool materials, iron ingot, gold ingot or diamond. The wooden club uses a **log**.

```
Dagger   Sabre    Scimitar  Spear    Pike     Lance    Halberd  Hatchet  War Hammer  Club
M        ..M      .MM       ..M      .MM      ..M      MMM      MM       MMM         .M
S        .M.      .M.       .SM      .SM      MM.      .S.      MS       MSM         S.
         S..      S..       S..      S..      S..      S..               .S.
```

## Layout

- `item/WeaponType` holds the per-weapon stats. `item/WeaponMaterial` holds the tiers. Edit these to rebalance.
- `item/WeaponItem` is the single item class. It behaves like a sword without the sweep attack.
- `item/WeaponAbility` is the ability interface; each `WeaponType` holds one. The implementations are in `ability/`,
  and their tooltip lines are generated into the lang file from `WeaponAbility.description()`.
- `mixin/PlayerMixin` captures the attack charge (vanilla resets it before item hooks run), turns off crits for the
  lance and applies armor crush. Halberds and hatchets disable shields through their `weapon` component.
- `effect/` holds the status effects; `BleedEffect.apply` handles stacking, immunity and the material durations.
- `combat/Motion` tracks player and mount speed on the server (for the brace and the couched charge).
- `entity/ThrownWeapon` is the thrown spear or hatchet; `ThrownWeaponRenderer` (client) draws its item model.
- `datagen/` (in `src/client`, because item models are client-only) generates models, item model
- Textures in `assets/weaponry/textures/item` are copied from `../pixel-art/weaponry/png/<tier>/` (render with `python render.py weaponry` there; `warhammer.png` → `<tier>_war_hammer.png`, `gold/` → `golden_`).

## Testing

`config/weaponry.json` (written on first launch):

```json
{ "testChest": true }
```

When `testChest` is on, every world load places a named double chest ("Weaponry Test Chest") 2 blocks
east of world spawn, holding one of each of the 50 weapons. Later launches refill that same chest and clear anything else in it. It defaults
to **on in the dev environment** (`runClient`/`runServer`, config in `run/config/`) and **off** in a normally
installed jar, so the code can stay in releases. Weapons have durability, so they stack to 1 and the chest holds one of each.

Commands: `/give @s weaponry:<material>_<weapon>`, e.g. `weaponry:iron_war_hammer`, `weaponry:golden_dagger`.

## Commands

```
./gradlew runDatagen   # regenerate src/main/generated after changing items
./gradlew runClient    # play-test
./gradlew build        # jar in build/libs
```

## Version notes (26.3)

Ported from the 1.21.1 baseline (via 26.1.2 and 26.2). Stats, recipes (except the spear), tiers, reach, the creative tab, the
config and the test chest are unchanged.

- **Build:** Minecraft 26.x ships unobfuscated: `net.fabricmc.fabric-loom` without a `mappings` line,
  `implementation` instead of `modImplementation`, Java 25. Datagen runs with `client = true`.
- **Items:** `TieredItem`/`Tier` are gone. `WeaponItem` extends `Item` and gets durability, repair item and
  enchantability from the vanilla `ToolMaterial` (durability scaled per weapon), plus `tool` and `weapon`
  components (1 durability per hit, 2 per block, can't break blocks in creative, like a sword).
  Items are registered with `Item.Properties.setId`.
- **No sweep:** vanilla sweeps only when the held item is in `#minecraft:swords`. Weapons aren't in it.
- **Enchanting:** `#minecraft:enchantable/sword` no longer exists. Weapons are in
  `#enchantable/melee_weapon` (Sharpness, Smite, Bane, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Looting at the table) but
  not in `#enchantable/sweeping`, so Sweeping Edge can't be applied (it would do nothing).
- **Item models:** item model definitions (`assets/weaponry/items/*.json`) are generated next to the models.
- **Vanilla spear:** 26.x has `minecraft:*_spear` (added in 1.21.11). Our ids are `weaponry:*_spear`, so
  nothing clashes, but vanilla's recipe uses our old spear shape. The spear recipe now has a wider head
  (`..M / .SM / S..`). Our spear is a plain melee weapon, not vanilla's charge/jab spear.
- **Test chest:** placed next to the world respawn point, in the respawn dimension.
- Attribute ids in commands have no `generic.` prefix (`minecraft:attack_damage`, `minecraft:entity_interaction_range`).
- **26.1.2 -> 26.2:** no gameplay change. Only datagen code moved: advancement criteria are in
  `net.minecraft.advancements.triggers`, and item tags are appended by registry key.
- **26.2 -> 26.3:** no gameplay change. The recipe provider is built from bootstrap contexts for recipes
  and advancements, and recipe-unlock advancements use the new `recipes` field (regenerated).

Abilities and status effects (ported from the 1.21.1 baseline, same behaviour):

- `use()` hooks return `InteractionResult`, `releaseUsing` returns whether it did something, and use
  animations are `ItemUseAnimation`. `WeaponAbility` follows those signatures.
- Server damage goes through `hurtServer(ServerLevel, ...)`; `Player.attack` calls `hurtOrSimulate`, which is
  what `PlayerMixin` wraps for armor crush. Effect ticks (`BleedEffect`) get the `ServerLevel`.
- Item cooldowns take an `ItemStack` (cooldown groups), and `Player.disableShield` takes the shield stack.
- The hatchet's axe mining builds the same `Tool` rules `ToolMaterial.applyToolProperties` gives an axe.
- Entity types are built with their `ResourceKey`. `ThrownWeaponRenderer` uses the render-state API
  (`createRenderState`/`extractRenderState`) and draws the item through `ItemModelResolver`.

Abilities and status effects (ported from the 1.21.1 baseline through 1.21.11, 26.1.2 and 26.2, same behaviour):

- **Shield breaking** is the `weapon` component's `disable_blocking_for_seconds` (5 s, the axe value) on
  halberds and hatchets; `canDisableShield()` is gone. The halberd hook disables a raised shield through its
  `blocks_attacks` component, the way an axe hit does.
- **Crits:** the jump-crit check moved to `Player.canCriticalAttack`, which `PlayerMixin` turns off for the
  lance. It checks `isMobilityRestricted()` instead of Blindness, and `AttackContext.vanillaCrit` follows it.
- `Player.sweepAttack()` is gone, so the scimitar sends the sweep particle itself, as the vanilla sweep does.
- Tooltips use the `appendHoverText(..., TooltipDisplay, Consumer<Component>, ...)` signature; the hatchet's
  `tool` component can break blocks in creative, like an axe.
- `AbstractArrow` moved to `projectile.arrow`, entities save through `ValueInput`/`ValueOutput`, and a thrown
  weapon bounces off a hit with `deflect`, like the 1.21.11 trident. `ThrownWeaponRenderer` submits the item
  through a `SubmitNodeCollector`.
- The nausea-style wobble field is `portalEffectIntensity`; `AbstractGolem` is in `animal.golem`; hands map
  to slots with `InteractionHand.asEquipmentSlot()`; the server comes from `level().getServer()`.
- 26.1.2 on top of 1.21.11: action-bar messages use `Player.sendOverlayMessage`, entity tags are checked
  with `Entity.is(TagKey)` (bleed's undead immunity), and `CameraRenderState` is in `state.level`.
- 26.2: `LivingEntity.knockback` also takes the damage source and damage, so ability knockback (scimitar sweep,
  lance charge, parry, war hammer smash) goes through `Abilities.knockback` with the attacker's melee source
  and no damage. Tag datagen adds items by registry key.
- 26.3: a thrown weapon bounces off through `deflect(..., Vec3)` only when the target takes projectile side
  effects (`projectileReceivesSideEffectsOnHit`), as the trident does; the halberd pull syncs with
  `needsSync`; `ThrownWeaponRenderer` rotates with `PoseStack.rotateDegrees`.
