# Weaponry (NeoForge 1.21.1)

NeoForge mod for Minecraft **1.21.1** (NeoForge 21.1.238, Java 21). It adds 10 melee weapons in 5 material tiers, for
50 items in total, each with its own abilities (see [Abilities](#abilities)).

Ported from the `fabric/1.21.1` branch; the gameplay is the same. See [NeoForge notes](#neoforge-notes) for how the
Fabric-only parts are done here.

## Side

`neoforge_minecraft_side=BOTH`: Weaponry adds items, so it must be installed on the server and on every client.

## Weapons

| Weapon | Dmg vs sword | Speed | Reach | Durability × | Two-handed* |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Dagger | −2 | 2.4 | 2.5 | 0.75 | |
| Sabre | −1 | 2.0 | 3.0 | 1.0 | |
| Scimitar | 0 | 1.6 | 3.0 | 1.0 | yes |
| Spear | −1 | 1.4 | 4.0 | 1.0 | |
| Pike | 0 | 1.0 | 5.0 | 1.2 | yes |
| Lance | −2 | 0.8 | 4.5 | 0.6 | yes |
| Halberd | +2 | 0.9 | 4.0 | 1.2 | yes |
| Hatchet | +1 | 1.1 | 2.75 | 1.0 | |
| War Hammer | +3 | 0.7 | 3.0 | 1.5 | yes |
| Club | −1 | 1.2 | 3.0 | 1.5 | |

Tiers are wooden, stone, iron, golden and diamond. Damage bonus, enchantability, repair item and base
durability all come from the vanilla tier. Source: `../pixel-art/weaponry/docs/weapon-stats.md`.

\* Needs both hands. While it's in the main hand, whatever is in the off hand (a shield, a torch...) is moved
into your inventory, and a two-handed weapon put in the off hand is moved out too. The action bar says what moved.
If the inventory is full, the item stays in the off hand but is blocked: no shield, no dual wielding, no off-hand
item use, and a raised shield is lowered.

## Abilities

From `../pixel-art/weaponry/docs/weapon-stats.md` section 4. "Full charge" means the attack cooldown is over 90%,
the same threshold vanilla uses for sweeps and crits.

| Weapon | Passive | Active |
|---|---|---|
| Dagger | **Backstab:** ×1.5 damage when hitting a target from behind (within 60° of straight behind it). Critical hits cause **Bleed**. | **Throw:** like the spear. Melee damage +1, and it causes **Bleed**. |
| Sabre | +2 damage while mounted. | **Riposte:** use to parry for 0.5 s (1 s cooldown). Parrying a frontal melee hit cancels it, and your next hit within 3 s is a guaranteed crit. |
| Scimitar | **Draw Cut:** full-charge, grounded, non-sprinting hits sweep, with about 1.5× the vanilla sweep area. Everything the sweep hits, the main target included, gets **Bleed**. | |
| Spear | Reach 4. +1 damage on a sprinting hit. | **Throw:** hold use (at least 0.5 s) and release. Melee damage +2. It drops where it lands; pick it up again. |
| Pike | Reach 5. Half damage against targets under 1.5 blocks away. | **Brace:** sneak and stand still. Hits on targets charging at you (2+ blocks/s, on foot or mounted) do double damage and dismount riders. |
| Lance | No critical hits. | **Couched Charge:** hit while riding a mount moving at 4+ blocks/s. Bonus damage = 0.8 × mount speed (blocks/s), max +15, plus heavy knockback and the target is dismounted. Costs 3 durability. |
| Halberd | Reach 4. Disables shields like an axe. | **Hook:** use on a target in reach (2 s cooldown, 1 durability). Pulls it toward you, pulls it off its mount, and knocks a raised shield aside. |
| Hatchet | Disables shields. Mines wood at axe speed and takes Efficiency, Fortune and Silk Touch. | **Throw:** like the spear, but short range and spinning. Melee damage +1. |
| War Hammer | **Armor Crush:** ignores 50% of the target's armor. Full-charge hits cause **Stagger** for 1 s. | **Overhead Smash:** a full-charge hit while sneaking knocks back everything within 2.5 blocks of the target, and everything it hits (target included) gets **Stun** for 0.75 s. |
| Club | +1 knockback. **Daze:** full-charge hits have a 20% chance to cause **Daze** for 2 s. | |

Material twists:

- **Wooden:** half the armor crush; Bleed lasts 2 s.
- **Stone:** +1 knockback on the club and war hammer.
- **Golden:** ability numbers × 1.5 (bonus damage, effect durations, daze chance, hook pull, smash knockback, armor crush).
- **Diamond:** +1 throw damage; Bleed lasts 6 s.

Status effects (`effect/ModEffects`), each with its own icon:

| Effect | Does | From |
|---|---|---|
| **Bleed** | 1 damage per second per stack for 4 s, ignoring armor and hit cooldown. Each new application adds a stack (max 3, shown as Bleed II/III) and refreshes the duration. Undead and golems are immune. | Dagger crits and throws, scimitar sweeps |
| **Stagger** | A short, sharp screen lurch for a staggered player. No slowdown. | War hammer full-charge hits |
| **Stun** | 90% slower, nearly rooted. | War hammer smash |
| **Daze** | 15% slower (like Slowness I), and a dazed player's view wobbles like Nausea. | Club |

The icons are drawn in `../pixel-art/weaponry/designs/effects/` (16×16). `python scripts/copy_effect_icons.py`
copies them to `textures/mob_effect/` with a 1 px transparent border, because the game draws effect icons at 18×18.
Bleed damage uses the `weaponry:bleed` damage type (`data/weaponry/damage_type/`), tagged to bypass armor and
hit cooldown.

Also not done yet: the lance's "−1 speed tier on foot" (it is already the slowest weapon), and the brace doesn't lock movement.

## Recipes (M = material, S = stick)

The material is planks, stone tool materials, iron ingot, gold ingot or diamond. The wooden club uses a **log**.

```
Dagger   Sabre    Scimitar  Spear    Pike     Lance    Halberd  Hatchet  War Hammer  Club
M        ..M      .MM       ..M      .MM      ..M      MMM      MM       MMM         .M
S        .M.      .M.       .S.      .SM      MM.      .S.      MS       MSM         S.
         S..      S..       S..      S..      S..      S..               .S.
```

## Layout

- `item/WeaponType` holds the per-weapon stats and abilities, `item/WeaponMaterial` the tiers. `item/WeaponItem` is the
  single item class; `item/ModItems` registers the items and the creative tab through `DeferredRegister`.
- `ability/` holds one class per weapon; `ability/Abilities` registers their NeoForge event listeners.
- `mixin/PlayerMixin` is the same as on Fabric: attack charge capture, crits and armor crush (`weaponry.mixins.json`,
  declared in `neoforge.mods.toml`).
- `effect/` holds the status effects, `entity/` the thrown weapon, `client/` its renderer and the screen wobble
  (`WeaponryClient` is the client-only `@Mod` entry point).
- `src/generated/resources` holds the models, lang, recipes, advancements and tags: the `fabric/1.21.1` branch's
  datagen output (vanilla formats). Textures and the bleed damage type are in `src/main/resources`.

## Testing

`config/weaponry.json` (written on first launch):

```json
{ "testChest": true }
```

When `testChest` is on, every world load places a named double chest ("Weaponry Test Chest") 2 blocks
east of world spawn, holding one of each of the 50 weapons. Later launches refill that same chest and clear anything else in it. It defaults
to **on in the dev environment** (`runClient`/`runServer`, config in `run/config/`) and **off** in a normally
installed jar, so the code can stay in releases. Weapons have durability, so they stack to 1 and the chest holds one of each.

Commands: `/give @s weaponry:<material>_<weapon>`, e.g. `weaponry:iron_war_hammer`, `weaponry:golden_dagger`.

## Commands

```
./gradlew build        # jar in build/libs
./gradlew runClient    # play-test
./gradlew runServer
```

`runServer` doesn't pass console input through; use RCON (`enable-rcon` in `run/server.properties`) or op yourself from
a client to run commands.

## NeoForge notes

Differences from the `fabric/1.21.1` branch:

- **Same mixins.** NeoForge runs Minecraft with Mojang names, so `PlayerMixin` applies unchanged; NeoForge ships
  MixinExtras. The config is declared with `[[mixins]]` in `neoforge.mods.toml`.
- **Registration** goes through `DeferredRegister` (items via `DeferredRegister.Items.registerItem`, which also sets
  the item id, the creative tab, the entity type and the effects). Effects are `DeferredHolder`s, which are `Holder`s,
  so effect code is unchanged; the entity type is resolved with `.get()`.
- **Events:** the server tick is `ServerTickEvent.Post`, the sabre parry is `LivingIncomingDamageEvent`, two-handed
  blocking is `PlayerInteractEvent.RightClickItem` / `RightClickBlock` / `EntityInteract`, and the test chest listens
  for `ServerStartedEvent`.
- **Client:** `WeaponryClient` registers the renderer in `EntityRenderersEvent.RegisterRenderers` and runs the
  Stagger/Daze wobble on `ClientTickEvent.Post`.
- **Config:** `config/weaponry.json` lives in `FMLPaths.CONFIGDIR`; the test chest defaults to on outside production.
- **Build:** ModDevGradle from `server-vein-miner`'s NeoForge branch. There is no datagen; the generated JSON comes from
  the Fabric branch (see Layout).
- **Shield breaking** uses NeoForge's `IItemExtension.canDisableShield` (vanilla `LivingEntity.canDisableShield` asks the item), so the Fabric `LivingEntityMixin` isn't needed.
