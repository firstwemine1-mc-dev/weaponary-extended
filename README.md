# Weaponry

Fabric mod for Minecraft **1.16.5** (Java 8, Mojang mappings). It adds 10 melee weapons in
5 material tiers, for 50 items in total, each with its own abilities (see [Abilities](#abilities)).

Built from the official [fabric-example-mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod)
template (`1.16.5` branch). A pristine copy of that template lives at `../fabric-example-mod`.
Ported from the 1.21.1 version; see [Version notes](#version-notes).

## Side

`"environment": "*"`. Install the mod on **both client and server**. New items are registered on the server and
synced to the client, so the mod can't be client-only, and a vanilla client can't join a server that has it.

## Weapons

| Weapon | Dmg vs sword | Speed | Reach | Durability × | Two-handed* |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Dagger | −2 | 2.4 | 2.5 | 0.75 | |
| Sabre | −1 | 2.0 | 3.0 | 1.0 | |
| Scimitar | 0 | 1.6 | 3.0 | 1.0 | yes |
| Spear | −1 | 1.4 | 4.0 | 1.0 | |
| Pike | 0 | 1.0 | 5.0 | 1.2 | yes |
| Lance | −2 | 0.8 | 4.5 | 0.6 | yes |
| Halberd | +2 | 0.9 | 4.0 | 1.2 | yes |
| Hatchet | +1 | 1.1 | 2.75 | 1.0 | |
| War Hammer | +3 | 0.7 | 3.0 | 1.5 | yes |
| Club | −1 | 1.2 | 3.0 | 1.5 | |

Tiers are wooden, stone, iron, golden and diamond. Damage bonus, enchantability, repair item and base
durability all come from the vanilla tier. Source: `../pixel-art/weaponry/docs/weapon-stats.md`.

\* Needs both hands. While it's in the main hand, whatever is in the off hand (a shield, a torch...) is moved
into your inventory, and a two-handed weapon put in the off hand is moved out too. The action bar says what moved.
If the inventory is full, the item stays in the off hand but is blocked: no shield, no dual wielding, no off-hand
item use, and a raised shield is lowered.

Reach is not applied on 1.16.5 (see [Version notes](#version-notes)).

## Abilities

From `../pixel-art/weaponry/docs/weapon-stats.md` section 4. "Full charge" means the attack cooldown is over 90%,
the same threshold vanilla uses for sweeps and crits.

| Weapon | Passive | Active |
|---|---|---|
| Dagger | **Backstab:** ×1.5 damage when hitting a target from behind (within 60° of straight behind it). Critical hits cause **Bleed**. | **Throw:** like the spear. Melee damage +1, and it causes **Bleed**. |
| Sabre | +2 damage while mounted. | **Riposte:** use to parry for 0.5 s (1 s cooldown). Parrying a frontal melee hit cancels it, and your next hit within 3 s is a guaranteed crit. |
| Scimitar | **Draw Cut:** full-charge, grounded, non-sprinting hits sweep, with about 1.5× the vanilla sweep area. Everything the sweep hits, the main target included, gets **Bleed**. | |
| Spear | Reach 4. +1 damage on a sprinting hit. | **Throw:** hold use (at least 0.5 s) and release. Melee damage +2. It drops where it lands; pick it up again. |
| Pike | Reach 5. Half damage against targets under 1.5 blocks away. | **Brace:** sneak and stand still. Hits on targets charging at you (2+ blocks/s, on foot or mounted) do double damage and dismount riders. |
| Lance | No critical hits. | **Couched Charge:** hit while riding a mount moving at 4+ blocks/s. Bonus damage = 0.8 × mount speed (blocks/s), max +15, plus heavy knockback and the target is dismounted. Costs 3 durability. |
| Halberd | Reach 4. Disables shields like an axe. | **Hook:** use on a target in reach (2 s cooldown, 1 durability). Pulls it toward you, pulls it off its mount, and knocks a raised shield aside. |
| Hatchet | Disables shields. Mines wood at axe speed and takes Efficiency, Fortune and Silk Touch. | **Throw:** like the spear, but short range and spinning. Melee damage +1. |
| War Hammer | **Armor Crush:** ignores 50% of the target's armor. Full-charge hits cause **Stagger** for 1 s. | **Overhead Smash:** a full-charge hit while sneaking knocks back everything within 2.5 blocks of the target, and everything it hits (target included) gets **Stun** for 0.75 s. |
| Club | +1 knockback. **Daze:** full-charge hits have a 20% chance to cause **Daze** for 2 s. | |

Material twists:

- **Wooden:** half the armor crush; Bleed lasts 2 s.
- **Stone:** +1 knockback on the club and war hammer.
- **Golden:** ability numbers × 1.5 (bonus damage, effect durations, daze chance, hook pull, smash knockback, armor crush).
- **Diamond:** +1 throw damage; Bleed lasts 6 s.

Status effects (`effect/ModEffects`), each with its own icon:

| Effect | Does | From |
|---|---|---|
| **Bleed** | 1 damage per second per stack for 4 s, ignoring armor and hit cooldown. Each new application adds a stack (max 3, shown as Bleed II/III) and refreshes the duration. Undead and golems are immune. | Dagger crits and throws, scimitar sweeps |
| **Stagger** | A short, sharp screen lurch for a staggered player. No slowdown. | War hammer full-charge hits |
| **Stun** | 90% slower, nearly rooted. | War hammer smash |
| **Daze** | 15% slower (like Slowness I), and a dazed player's view wobbles like Nausea. | Club |

The icons are drawn in `../pixel-art/weaponry/designs/effects/` (16×16). `python scripts/copy_effect_icons.py`
copies them to `textures/mob_effect/` with a 1 px transparent border, because the game draws effect icons at 18×18.
Bleed damage uses the `weaponry:bleed` damage type (`data/weaponry/damage_type/`), tagged to bypass armor and
hit cooldown.

Also not done yet: the lance's "−1 speed tier on foot" (it is already the slowest weapon), and the brace doesn't lock movement.

## Recipes (M = material, S = stick)

The material is planks, stone tool materials, iron ingot, gold ingot or diamond. The wooden club uses a **log**.

```
Dagger   Sabre    Scimitar  Spear    Pike     Lance    Halberd  Hatchet  War Hammer  Club
M        ..M      .MM       ..M      .MM      ..M      MMM      MM       MMM         .M
S        .M.      .M.       .S.      .SM      MM.      .S.      MS       MSM         S.
         S..      S..       S..      S..      S..      S..               .S.
```

## Layout

- `item/WeaponType` holds the per-weapon stats. `item/WeaponMaterial` holds the tiers. Edit these to rebalance.
- `item/WeaponItem` is the single item class. It behaves like a sword without the sweep attack.
- `mixin/WeaponEnchantmentCategoryMixin` lets weapons take sword enchantments, and `mixin/WeaponDiggerCategoryMixin`
  lets the hatchet take Efficiency, Fortune and Silk Touch (see [Version notes](#version-notes)).
- `item/WeaponAbility` is the ability interface; each `WeaponType` holds one. The implementations are in `ability/`.
  Their tooltip lines (`WeaponAbility.description()`) are in the lang file under `tooltip.weaponry.<weapon>.<n>`.
- `mixin/PlayerMixin` captures the attack charge (vanilla resets it before item hooks run), adds the ability damage
  bonus, turns off crits for the lance, applies armor crush and lets halberds and hatchets disable shields.
  `mixin/LivingEntityMixin` runs the sabre parry.
- `effect/` holds the status effects; `BleedEffect.apply` handles stacking, immunity and the material durations.
- `combat/Motion` tracks player and mount speed on the server (for the brace and the couched charge).
- `entity/ThrownWeapon` is the thrown spear, hatchet or dagger; `entity/SpawnPacket` spawns it on the client, and
  `client/render/ThrownWeaponRenderer` draws its item model.
- `src/main/generated` holds the models, lang, recipes and recipe advancements. There is no datagen on
  1.16.5 (see [Version notes](#version-notes)).
- Textures in `assets/weaponry/textures/item` are copied from `../pixel-art/weaponry/png/<tier>/` (render with `python render.py weaponry` there; `warhammer.png` → `<tier>_war_hammer.png`, `gold/` → `golden_`).

## Testing

`config/weaponry.json` (written on first launch):

```json
{ "testChest": true }
```

When `testChest` is on, every world load places a named double chest ("Weaponry Test Chest") 2 blocks
east of world spawn, holding one of each of the 50 weapons. Later launches refill that same chest and clear anything else in it. It defaults
to **on in the dev environment** (`runClient`/`runServer`, config in `run/config/`) and **off** in a normally
installed jar, so the code can stay in releases. Weapons have durability, so they stack to 1 and the chest holds one of each.

Commands: `/give @s weaponry:<material>_<weapon>`, e.g. `weaponry:iron_war_hammer`, `weaponry:golden_dagger`.

## Commands

```
./gradlew runClient    # play-test
./gradlew build        # jar in build/libs
```

## Version notes

Differences from the 1.21.1 version:

- **No reach.** The `entity_interaction_range` attribute only exists from 1.20.5, so every weapon has the
  vanilla 3-block reach. The reach values stay in `WeaponType` for later versions.
- **Attributes** come from `getDefaultAttributeModifiers(EquipmentSlot)` with the vanilla
  `BASE_ATTACK_DAMAGE_UUID` / `BASE_ATTACK_SPEED_UUID` modifiers, not from item components.
- **Enchanting.** Enchantments aren't tag-based yet: sharpness, smite, bane of arthropods, knockback, fire
  aspect, looting and sweeping edge use the `WEAPON` category, which only accepts `SwordItem`. Weapons
  aren't swords, because `Player.attack` sweeps with any `SwordItem`. Fabric API has no hook for this here,
  so `WeaponEnchantmentCategoryMixin` makes that category accept weapons. That covers the enchanting table,
  the anvil and `/enchant`. Unbreaking, mending and vanishing work on any damageable item already.
  Sweeping edge can be applied but does nothing, as on 1.21.1.
- **Durability per block** is handled in `WeaponItem.mineBlock` (2 per block, like a sword) instead of the
  `tool` component.
- **Creative tab:** built with `FabricItemGroupBuilder`, and items join it through
  `Item.Properties.tab`. Its translation key is `itemGroup.weaponry.weapons`.
- **Data:** recipes in `data/weaponry/recipes` with `result.item` and no recipe category. No item tags:
  the `enchantable/*` tags and `breaks_decorated_pots` don't exist yet, so there is no tag provider.
- **No datagen.** Fabric API for 1.16 has no data generation module, so the `datagen/` package and
  `runDatagen` are gone. `src/main/generated` is the 1.18.2 branch's datagen output, added to the
  resources in `build.gradle`. The recipe advancements were converted to the 1.16.5 item predicate
  (`"item": "minecraft:iron_ingot"` instead of `"items": [...]`). After changing items or recipes,
  regenerate on a newer branch and copy the files over, converting the advancements the same way.
- **Java 8:** `WeaponTier` is a class instead of a record, and `TestChest` avoids `instanceof` patterns
  and `List.of`. The logger is Log4j (`LogManager`), as in the 1.16.5 template.
- **One source set.** Loom can only split client and common code on versions with a bundled server
  jar (1.18+), so `WeaponryClient` lives in `src/main/java` and is still only loaded on the client.
- Fabric API's mod id is `fabric` here, so `fabric.mod.json` depends on `fabric`.
- `Registry.ITEM` instead of `BuiltInRegistries`, `new ResourceLocation(...)`, and the test chest is
  named with `setCustomName(new TextComponent(...))` (`Component.literal` came in 1.19). The world has no
  negative heights, so the chest search runs from the build limit down to y 0.

Abilities and status effects (same behaviour as 1.21.1, except where noted):

- **Reach-based abilities** use the weapon's listed reach where they need one: the halberd hook reaches
  4 blocks. Melee reach itself is still vanilla (no attribute).
- **Damage bonus.** There is no `Item.getAttackDamageBonus` yet, so `PlayerMixin` adds the ability bonus to
  the attack damage attribute read at the start of `Player.attack`. That is before the charge scaling, so on
  this version flat bonuses (sabre mounted +2, spear sprint +1, the lance charge) shrink with a weak,
  uncharged hit instead of applying in full.
- **Hatchet mining.** There is no `#minecraft:mineable/axe` tag before 1.17 and the axe's block list is
  private, so `getDestroySpeed` asks a vanilla wooden axe whether it digs the block faster than by hand,
  then uses the hatchet's tier speed. Axes don't gate drops in this version, so nothing else is needed.
  It costs 1 durability per block like an axe, and `WeaponDiggerCategoryMixin` lets it take the
  `DIGGER` enchantments.
- **Effects** are plain `MobEffect` fields with UUID attribute modifiers; Bleed ticks through
  `isDurationEffectTick`. Undead immunity uses `MobType.UNDEAD` (there is no `#minecraft:undead` tag yet).
- **Bleed damage.** Damage types aren't data-driven before 1.19.4, so bleed ticks use a
  `new DamageSource("weaponry.bleed").bypassArmor()` (same death message key). There are no damage type
  tags to skip the hit cooldown, so the bleed tick clears `invulnerableTime` before it hurts.
- **Sabre parry** treats armor-bypassing sources as unblockable (there is no `#minecraft:bypasses_shield` tag).
- `Entity.level` is a field and `onGround()` is `isOnGround()` in this version.
- **No `ALLOW_DAMAGE` event** in this Fabric API, so `LivingEntityMixin` runs the sabre parry at the start of
  `LivingEntity.hurt` instead.
- **No `canDisableShield()`.** `Player.blockUsingShield` checks for an `AxeItem` itself, so `PlayerMixin` disables
  the shield at the end of it when the attacker holds a halberd or hatchet.
- `DamageSource`'s constructor and `bypassArmor()` are protected, so bleed uses a small subclass; text uses
  `TranslatableComponent`.
- **Client:** the nausea-style wobble field is still `portalTime` (Stagger and Daze set it), and
  `ThrownWeaponRenderer` uses `Vector3f` rotations and `ItemTransforms.TransformType.NONE`.
- **Thrown weapons** keep their own item stack (`AbstractArrow` has none in this version), as the trident does,
  and use `EnchantmentHelper.getDamageBonus` for Sharpness and the like.
- **Scimitar sweep** uses `EnchantmentHelper.getSweepingDamageRatio` (there is no sweeping attribute) and,
  like the vanilla sweep of this version, applies no per-target enchantment damage.
- The war hammer smash plays the anvil landing sound (the mace sounds are 1.21).
- **Spawning thrown weapons.** The 1.16 client only creates vanilla entity types from
  `ClientboundAddEntityPacket`, so `ThrownWeapon` sends `SpawnPacket` over a Fabric networking channel
  (`weaponry:spawn_entity`) and `WeaponryClient` spawns it the way vanilla spawns an arrow. The weapon item
  follows in the normal entity data packet.
- **Java 8:** no `instanceof` patterns, records, switch expressions, `var` or `List.of` (`ImmutableList.of`).
- `addEffect` takes no source entity, `knockback` takes a `float`, rotations are the `xRot`/`yRot` fields,
  `getEyePosition` needs a partial tick, and the player's `inventory`/`abilities` are fields.
- Renderers register through `EntityRendererRegistry.INSTANCE` with an `EntityRenderDispatcher`, and
  `ThrownWeaponRenderer` gets the item renderer from `Minecraft.getInstance()`.
- New lang keys (tooltips, effects, death messages, messages) were added to `src/main/generated` by hand,
  copied from the 1.18.2 branch's datagen output.
- **Dev multiplayer:** the 1.16.5 client asks Mojang's social-interactions service whether it may join servers
  and chat, and that service turns the offline dev account away ("Multiplayer is disabled"). The client-only
  `mixin/client/DevMultiplayerMixin` allows both, but only when `FabricLoader.isDevelopmentEnvironment()`, so
  `runClient`/`runClient2` can join the dev server. Normal installs are unaffected.
- **Client-only vanilla methods.** This branch compiles against the merged client+server jar, so a call to a
  client-only method builds fine and then crashes a dedicated server. `ProjectileUtil.getEntityHitResult(Entity, ...)`
  and `Vec3.directionFromRotation` are client-only here, so the halberd hook does its own entity raycast and the
  dagger works out the target's facing itself.
